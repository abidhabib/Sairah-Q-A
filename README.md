## Guidelines to Achieve All Content

1. **Stay Consistent**: Dedicate the recommended time to each subject, ensuring all chapters are covered before exam day.
2. **Break Tasks Into Segments**: Don't overwhelm yourself with large chunks of content. Focus on one topic at a time, as shown in the timetable.
3. **Solve Practice Papers**: This is essential. Practice will help you solidify concepts, spot weaknesses, and increase your exam confidence.
4. **Use Active Recall**: As you study, periodically test yourself on what you've learned, helping reinforce the information.
5. **Revise Key Formulas and Concepts**: Make sure to review important formulas for **Mathematics**, **Physics**, and **Chemistry**, as they are critical for solving problems efficiently.
6. **Stay Positive and Focused**: It's normal to feel some pressure, but keep your mindset focused on achieving success.
7. **Take Breaks**: Don't forget to take short breaks in between study sessions. A 10-15 minute break after every 50 minutes of study helps with focus.
